Project Pink ball
======================

On Feb. 22th, 2 days before the Lantern Festival in China, I created this respository in memory of something and an idea of creating a game came.

The game is originated from a Chinese poem(now in English):

    When all at once I turn my head, find her there lantern light is dimly shed.

You can visit the page located at Github Page to play the game.

Hope you will enjoy it. :)
